        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>As a mobile developer specializing in Flutter, I want my portfolio site's home page to showcase my skills, experience, and expertise. The main focus of the home page will be a list of my best projects that I've developed using Flutter.</p>
        <p>Each project on the list will have a brief description and a link to a detailed project page that will provide more information about the project and the technologies that I used to develop it. This will give visitors a clear sense of my technical capabilities and the kind of work that I am capable of producing.</p>
        <p>In addition to the project list, I will include a brief bio that highlights my experience as a mobile developer, particularly my expertise in Flutter. I will emphasize my proficiency in Dart, the programming language used by Flutter, and my familiarity with Flutter's many features, such as widgets, hot reload, and stateful hot reload.</p>
        <p>To further showcase my skills and expertise, I may also include some sample code snippets or links to open-source projects that I have contributed to. This will help visitors see the quality of my code and the contributions that I have made to the Flutter community.</p>
        <p>Finally, I will include some personal touches that help visitors get to know me better. This might include a photo of myself, a brief statement about my philosophy on mobile development, or some fun facts about my interests and hobbies outside of work.</p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Technology </h3>
        <p>As a mobile developer who specializes in Flutter and Firebase, I have a strong understanding of the technologies and tools that are commonly used in this field. Flutter is my go-to mobile app development framework, as it allows me to build high-performance, cross-platform apps for Android and iOS using a single codebase. I am proficient in Dart, the programming language used by Flutter, and I appreciate its ease of use and its many features, such as garbage collection and async/await syntax.</p>
        <p>Firebase is another technology that I rely on heavily in my work. As a mobile and web application development platform, Firebase provides a wide range of tools and services that are essential for building and growing mobile apps. Some of the Firebase services that I use most often include cloud storage, authentication, real-time databases, messaging, and analytics. I have also worked extensively with FlutterFire, a set of libraries that provide Flutter developers with easy access to Firebase services.</p>
        <p>When it comes to development tools, I am comfortable using a range of IDEs and code editors, including Android Studio, Xcode, and Visual Studio Code. These tools provide a wealth of features that make it easier for me to write, test, and debug code, including code completion, debugging, and profiling.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>The contact page on my portfolio site will be simple and straightforward. Instead of a traditional contact form, users will find links to my social media profiles, including LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook.</p>
        <p>By providing links to these platforms, visitors can easily connect with me and learn more about my professional experience and personal interests. I believe that these social media profiles will give potential clients or collaborators a better understanding of who I am as a person and what I bring to the table as a mobile developer.</p>
        <p>In addition to the social media links, I may also include a brief message inviting visitors to reach out to me with any questions or inquiries. This will give users an opportunity to connect with me directly and learn more about my availability for freelance work or collaboration opportunities.</p>
