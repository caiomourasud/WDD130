            Hello everyone! My name is Caio, I'm 30 and I'm from Rio de Janeiro-BR 
            and I'm living in Curitiba-BR, the coldest capital in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to run outdoors and I like to photograph people in relaxed and fun moments.

            I'm a Mobile Software Engineer at a Utah company called REDX in 
            the Real State area. I have just started the Bachelor's of 
            Applied Technology course to obtain an international diploma and 
            progress more and more in the professional area, and of course improve my English.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am very interested in BYU-Idaho because I can study from home and progress 
            with my time, and the credits are very affordable.

            I've been a member of the church since I was 17, and I learned from my 
            Mission President that "When it's difficult but we can feel the Lord's hands 
            helping us, it's because we're on the right path".
